Go dependency managment
=======================

Status: in limbo, see T725.

Overview
--------

We currently use external Bazel repositories/workspaces, defined in `third_party/go/repositories.bzl`. These are currently generated by a hack in `third_party/go/gazelle-deps.sh`, based on constraints defined within that same script.

If you need to add a dependency, edit `gazelle-deps.sh` and add your dependency there long the others. To quickly iterate, place it on the top before an `exit 0` statement, then once verified move it to an appropriate position within the list and re-run the script one last time to ensure the generates `repositories.bzl` is up to date with `gazelle-deps.sh`.
