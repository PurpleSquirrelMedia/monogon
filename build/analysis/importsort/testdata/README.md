Test data for //build/analysis/importsort
===

This directory contains a fake GOPATH-like structure used to test the importsort analyzer. Files have the .notgo extension to prevent smart editors/IDEs from reformatting broken files, and to prevent Gazelle and other automation from ingesting these files as part of the main build.
